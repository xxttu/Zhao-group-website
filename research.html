          <p>Our research is driven by the thrilling prospect of discovering and manipulating new states of matter. This endeavor focuses on exploring the complex interactions among various elements, including reduced dimensionality, wavefunction topology, electron-electron interactions, relativistic spin-orbit coupling, and key symmetries.  
            <p>exploring new quantum behaviors often meant delving into the unknown by creating novel single crystals. Yet, the rapid evolution of quantum physics today calls for a broader, more versatile strategy for the development of cutting-edge quantum materials. The integration of varied material monolayers into thin films and nanostructures, celebrated for their unique properties and technological potential, marks a significant trend. Techniques like Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) and the stacking of van der Waals materials are crucial for creating new materials with strong or weak interface couplings, respectively. These methods are essential for discovering novel quantum phenomena. Thin films leverage atomically precise interfaces â€” a contrast to bulk crystals â€” enabling exploitation of asymmetry and reduced dimensions. This leads to changes in chemical potential, epitaxial strain application, and new functional phases. Recent breakthroughs, especially in precisely controlling heterostructure construction and twist angles in layered 2D materials, have been groundbreaking.</p> 
          <p> Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is a powerful technique that enables imaging and characterization of surfaces at the atomic scale. Developed by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer in the early 1980s, STM operates based on the quantum tunneling effect, where a sharp conductive tip is brought within angstrom-scale proximity to a materialâ€™s surface. By applying a bias voltage between the tip and the sample, electrons tunnel through the vacuum gap, generating a tunneling current that is highly sensitive to the tip-sample separation. This allows STM to map atomic topography with unparalleled resolution. Beyond imaging, Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) provides insight into the local electronic density of states, making STM a crucial tool for studying quantum materials, including superconductors, topological phases, and correlated electron systems. Additionally, specialized techniques such as Spin-Polarized STM (SP-STM) enable atomic-scale probing of magnetic properties. STM is typically operated in ultra-high vacuum and at cryogenic temperatures to minimize external disturbances. Its applications range from fundamental surface science and quantum material research to nanotechnology, including atomic manipulation and molecular assembly. By providing real-space imaging and spectroscopic capabilities, STM remains an essential tool in modern condensed matter physics and nanoscience, driving discoveries in emergent quantum phenomena. </p>
